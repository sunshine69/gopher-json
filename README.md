# gopher-json [![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/layeh.com/gopher-json?status.svg)](https://godoc.org/layeh.com/gopher-json)

Package json is a simple JSON encoder/decoder for [gopher-lua](https://github.com/yuin/gopher-lua).

## UPDATE

This is a fork of https://github.com/layeh/gopher-json but I do not intend to create merge request as it is a bit intrusive. WHat has been done:
- Create go.mod file to be compatible with new go version
- Use jsoniter for higher performance
